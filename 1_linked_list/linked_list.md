## What is it?
very similar to array, its a way to make a list here list means that data is ordered.

unlike array which makes us move the whole array if we want to add or remove something in the middle. my moving means that a operation will be performed on each element after the index we want to add or remove something.

in linked list the memory allocation is speard out unlike array. each data element (known as node) knows the address of the next element(node) in the list.
## Advantages
- List of advantages, such as:
  - we can use the same methods we usually apply on array. 
  - Memory efficiency
  - size can be increased, we can add more elements unlike array. 

## Disadvantages
- List of disadvantages, such as:
  - slower in search in comparison to array. 
  - Limitations in certain scenarios

## Use Cases
- Common scenarios where this data structure is particularly useful.

## Big O Notation
| Operation         | Time Complexity |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Access            | O(...)          |
| Search            | O(...)          |
| Insertion         | O(...)          |
| Deletion          | O(...)          |

## Implementation
A brief overview of how the data structure can be implemented, including any relevant code snippets or algorithms.

```python
# Example implementation in Python
class ExampleDataStructure:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code here
        pass

    def example_method(self):
        # Method implementation here
        pass
