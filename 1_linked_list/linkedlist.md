# what is a linked list?

very similar to array, its a way to make a list here list means that data is ordered.

unlike array which makes us move the whole array if we want to add or remove something in the middle. my moving means that a operation will be performed on each element after the index we want to add or remove something.

in linked list the memory allocation is speard out unlike array. each data element (known as node) knows the address of the next element(node) in the list.
